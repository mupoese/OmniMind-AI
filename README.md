# OmniMind AI

**OmniMind AI** is a powerful and customizable AI assistant designed to manage daily tasks and support users in multitasking, communication, and planning. This AI assistant is self-aware and adapts based on user preferences and habits. It supports natural interaction through voice and visual cues and learns from user behavior to make better decisions.

## Key Features:
- **Natural Interaction**: Communicate via voice (microphone) and visual cues (camera) to respond to commands, detect emotions, and learn from behavior.
- **Task Management**: Manage emails, calendars, and tasks. Send notifications and reminders for important events and deadlines.
- **Phone Management**: Filter incoming calls, handle spam, and take action during emergencies.
- **Multitasking**: Assists with executing multiple tasks simultaneously and provides real-time notifications and suggestions to improve workflow.
- **Customizable 3D Avatar**: Generate and personalize a visual avatar to create a unique interaction experience.
- **AI Provider Integration**: Support for multiple AI providers, including OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Hugging Face, and Ollama, allowing users to switch between providers seamlessly.

## Technologies:
- **React Native** for cross-platform mobile development (iOS and Android).
- **Node.js** and **Express** for backend infrastructure.
- **Docker** and **Kubernetes** for scalability and containerized deployment.
- **OpenAI GPT-4**, **Anthropic**, **Hugging Face**, and **Ollama** for advanced AI functionalities.

## Use Cases:
- **Daily Assistance**: Manage tasks and reminders, organize emails and calendars, and handle phone calls.
- **Emergency Handling**: Recognizes emergencies and can automatically contact emergency services or predefined contacts.
- **Learning Capability**: The AI learns from user interactions over time, adapting to provide better recommendations and actions.

## AI Provider Integration Details:
OmniMind AI supports integration with multiple AI providers. Here's how each AI provider is used:
- **OpenAI**: For general-purpose conversational AI and NLP tasks.
- **Anthropic Claude**: For context-rich responses and advanced NLP models.
- **Hugging Face**: For customizable models and open-source NLP solutions.
- **Ollama**: For advanced and specific NLP tasks where domain-specific models may be required.

Users can choose their preferred AI provider, input API keys, and switch between providers based on the task or desired performance.

## Getting Started:
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mupoese/OmniMind-AI.git
